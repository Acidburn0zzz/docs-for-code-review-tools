Pattern: Line is too long

Issue: -

## Description

Your source code should not contain very long lines. The default wrapping in most tools disrupts the visual structure of the code, making it more difficult to understand.

Exceptions:
- comments
- raw-string literals
- `#include` statements
- header guards
