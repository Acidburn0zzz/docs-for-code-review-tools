Pattern: Missing `explicit` for constructor

Issue: -

## Description

Type conversion operators, and constructors that are callable with a single argument, must be marked `explicit` in the class definition. As an exception, copy and move constructors should not be `explicit`, since they do not perform type conversion. Implicit conversions can sometimes be necessary and appropriate for types that are designed to transparently wrap other types. In that case, contact your project leads to request a waiver of this rule.

Constructors that cannot be called with a single argument should usually omit `explicit`. Constructors that take a single `std::initializer_list` parameter should also omit `explicit`, in order to support copy-initialization (e.g. `MyType m = {1, 2};`).
