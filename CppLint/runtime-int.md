Pattern: Misused integer type

Issue: -

## Description

Of the built-in C++ integer types, the only one used is `int`. If a program needs a variable of a different size, use a precise-width integer type from `<stdint.h>`, such as `int16_t`. If your variable represents a value that could ever be greater than or equal to 2^31 (2GiB), use a 64-bit type such as `int64_t`. Keep in mind that even if your value won't ever be too large for an `int`, it may be used in intermediate calculations which may require a larger type. When in doubt, choose a larger type.
