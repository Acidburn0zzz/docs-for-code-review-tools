Pattern: Missing use of `SHELL` instruction

Issue: -

## Description

Docker provides a `SHELL` instruction which does not require overwriting `/bin/sh` in your container.

The `SHELL` instruction is particularly useful on Windows where there are two commonly used and quite different native shells: `cmd` and `powershell`, as well as alternate shells available including `sh`.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```dockerfile
# Install bash
RUN apk add --update-cache bash=4.3.42-r3

# Use bash as the default shell
RUN ln -sfv /bin/bash /bin/sh
```

Example of **correct** code:

```dockerfile
# Install bash
RUN apk add --update-cache bash=4.3.42-r3

# Use bash as the default shell
SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-c"]
```
