Pattern: Use of deprecated `MAINTAINER`

Issue: -

## Description

The `LABEL` instruction is a much more flexible version of this and you should use it instead, as it enables setting any metadata you require, and can be viewed easily, for example with `docker inspect`.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```dockerfile
MAINTAINER SvenDowideit@home.org.au
```

Example of **correct** code:

```dockerfile
LABEL maintainer="SvenDowideit@home.org.au"
```
