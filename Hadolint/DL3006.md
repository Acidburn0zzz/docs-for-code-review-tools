Pattern: Use of untagged image

Issue: -

## Description

Prefer a tagged image, for example `ubuntu:12.04`. That way you always know exactly what variant of an image is being used.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```dockerfile
FROM debian
```

Example of **correct** code:

```dockerfile
FROM debian:jessie
```
## Exceptions

When the image name refers to a previously defined alias:

```dockerfile
FROM debian:jessie as build

RUN build_script

FROM build as tests

RUN test_script

FROM debian:jessie

COPY --from=build foo .
```
