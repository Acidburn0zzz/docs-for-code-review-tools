Pattern: Use of `latest` image tag

Issue: -

## Description

You should not rely that `latest` tags is a specific version. It's prone to errors if the image will ever update. Prefer a specific tagged image, that way you always know exactly what variant of an image is being used.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
```

Example of **correct** code:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:12.04
```
