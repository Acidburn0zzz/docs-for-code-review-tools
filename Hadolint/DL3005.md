Pattern: Use of `apt-get upgrade` or `dist-upgrade`

Issue: -

## Description

You should avoid `RUN apt-get upgrade` or `dist-upgrade`, as many of the “essential” packages from the parent images won’t upgrade inside an [unprivileged container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration). If a package contained in the parent image is out-of-date, you should contact its maintainers.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get upgrade 
```

Example of **correct** code:

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update
```
