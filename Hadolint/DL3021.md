Pattern: Missing `/` for `COPY` instruction

Issue: -

## Description

If multiple `<src>` resources are specified, either directly or due to the use of a wildcard, then `<dest>` must be a directory, and it must end with a slash `/`.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```dockerfile
FROM node:carbon
COPY package.json yarn.lock my_app
```

Example of **correct** code:

```dockerfile
FROM node:carbon
COPY package.json yarn.lock my_app/
```
