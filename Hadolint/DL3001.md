Pattern: Invalid command for _Docker_ container

Issue: -

## Description

For some _POSIX_ commands it makes no sense to run them in a _Docker_ container because they are bound to the host or are otherwise dangerous (like `shutdown`, `service`, `ps`, `free`, `top`, `kill`, `mount`).

Example of **incorrect** code:

```dockerfile
FROM busybox
RUN top
```

Example of **correct** code:

```dockerfile
FROM busybox
```
