Pattern: Missing version pinning for `apt-get install`

Issue: -

## Description

Version pinning forces the build to retrieve a particular version regardless of whatâ€™s in the cache. This technique can also reduce failures due to unanticipated changes in required packages.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get install python
```

Example of **correct** code:

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get install python=2.7
```
