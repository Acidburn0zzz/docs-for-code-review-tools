Pattern: Use of `sudo`

Issue: -

## Description

Avoid installing or using `sudo` since it has unpredictable TTY and signal-forwarding behavior that can cause problems. If you absolutely need functionality similar to `sudo`, such as initializing the daemon as root but running it as non-root), consider using `gosu`.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```dockerfile
RUN sudo apt-get install
```

Example of **correct** code:

```dockerfile
