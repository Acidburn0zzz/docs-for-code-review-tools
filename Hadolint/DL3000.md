Pattern: Use of relative path for `WORKDIR`

Issue: -

## Description

For clarity and reliability, prefer using absolute paths for your `WORKDIR`. Also, you should use `WORKDIR` instead of proliferating instructions like `RUN cd â€¦ && do-something`, which are hard to read, troubleshoot, and maintain.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```dockerfile
WORKDIR usr/src/app
```

Example of **correct** code:

```dockerfile
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
```
## Exceptions

When using environment replacements.

```dockerfile
FROM busybox
ENV foo /bar
WORKDIR ${foo}   # WORKDIR /bar
```
