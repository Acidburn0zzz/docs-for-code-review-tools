Pattern: Missing use of JSON notation for `CMD`/`ENTRYPOINT`

Issue: -

## Description

When using the plain text version of passing arguments, signals from the OS are not correctly passed to the executables, which is in the majority of the cases what you would expect.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```dockerfile
FROM busybox
ENTRYPOINT s3cmd
```

```dockerfile
FROM busybox
CMD my-service server
```

Example of **correct** code:

```dockerfile
FROM busybox
ENTRYPOINT ["s3cmd"]
```

```dockerfile
FROM busybox
CMD ["my-service", "server"]
```

**Warning**: Docker `CMD` does not process `$ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE`s, thatâ€™s a side-effect of using `sh -c` as the default entry-point. Using the JSON notation means that you have to figure out how to handle environment variables yourself.
