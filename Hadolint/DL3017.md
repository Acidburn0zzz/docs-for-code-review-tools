Pattern: Use of `apk upgrade`

Issue: -

## Description

You should avoid `RUN apk upgrade` as many of the “essential” packages from the parent images won’t upgrade inside an [unprivileged container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration). If a package contained in the parent image is out-of-date, you should contact its maintainers. If you know there’s a particular package, `foo`, that needs to be updated, use `apt-get install -y foo` to update automatically.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```dockerfile
RUN apk update \
    && apk upgrade \
    && apk add curl
```

Example of **correct** code:

```dockerfile
 RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl
```
