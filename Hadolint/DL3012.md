Pattern: Missing email address or URL for `MAINTAINER`

Issue: -

## Description

This rule is DEPRECATED and no longer active.

If you only have a name and not an email address or URL, no one can contact
you and therefore the `MAINTAINER` information could also be omitted.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```dockerfile
FROM busybox
MAINTAINER lukas
```

Example of **correct** code:

```dockerfile
FROM busybox
MAINTAINER Lukas Martinelli <me@lukasmartinelli.ch>
```

```dockerfile
FROM busybox
MAINTAINER Lukas Martinelli http://lukasmartinelli.ch
```
