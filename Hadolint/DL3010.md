Pattern: Missing use of `ADD` for extracting archives into an image

Issue: -

## Description

Generally speaking, `COPY` is preferred because itâ€™s more transparent. `ADD` has some features (like local-only tar extraction and remote URL support) that are not immediately obvious. Consequently, the best use for `ADD` is local tar file auto-extraction into the image, as in `ADD rootfs.tar.xz /`.
