Pattern: Use of `ADD` instead of `COPY`

Issue: -

## Description

Generally speaking, `COPY` is preferred because itâ€™s more transparent. `ADD` has some features (like local-only tar extraction and remote URL support) that are not immediately obvious. Consequently, the best use for `ADD` is local tar file auto-extraction into the image, as in `ADD rootfs.tar.xz /`.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.4
ADD requirements.txt /usr/src/app/
```

Example of **correct** code:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.4
COPY requirements.txt /usr/src/app/
```
