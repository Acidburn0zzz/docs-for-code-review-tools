Pattern: Confusing with statement

Issue: -

## Description

Emitted when a `with` statement component returns multiple values and uses name binding with `as` only for a part of those values, as in with ctx() as a, b. This can be misleading, since it's not clear if the context manager returns a tuple or if the node without a name binding is another context manager.
