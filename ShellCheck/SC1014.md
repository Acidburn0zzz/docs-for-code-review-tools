Pattern: Missing use of `if cmd; then ..` or `if [[ $(cmd) == .. ]]`

Issue: -

## Description

`[ .. ]` is not part of shell syntax like `if` statements. It is not equivalent to parentheses in C-like languages, `if (foo) { bar; }`, and should not be wrapped around commands to test. 

If you want to check the exit status of a certain command, use that command directly as demonstrated in the correct code.

If you want to check the output of a command, use `"$(..)"` to get its output, and then use `test` or  `[`/`[[` to do a string comparison:

```
# Check output of `whoami` against the string `root`
if [ "$(whoami)" = "root" ]
then
  echo "Running as root"
fi
```

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
if [ grep -q pattern file ]
then
  echo "Found a match"
fi
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
if grep -q pattern file
then
  echo "Found a match"
fi

```
