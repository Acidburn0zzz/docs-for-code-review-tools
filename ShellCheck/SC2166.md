Pattern: Use of `[ p -a q ]`/`[ p -o q ]`

Issue: -

## Description

`-a` and `-o` to mean AND and OR in a `[ .. ]` test expression is not well defined. They are obsolescent extensions in [POSIX](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/test.html) and the lack of additional quoting levels means that expressions involving these operators are often ambiguous. Values that begin with hyphens and the `!` string are the usual issues.

Using multiple `[ .. ]` expressions with shell AND/OR operators `&&` and `||` is well defined and therefore preferred (but note that they have equal precedence, while `-a`/`-o` is unspecified but usually implemented as `-a` having higher precedence).

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
[ "$1" = "test" -a -z "$2" ]
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
[ "$1" = "test" ] && [ -z "$2" ]
```

## Exceptions

If the shell variant being used is ksh derived (such as the bash shell) it will have the shell builtin command `[[ ... ]]`. This has the operators `&&`, `||`, `(`, `)`, `!` which safely avoid the ambiguity by noting which arguments were quoted and requiring the operators to be unquoted (except by the `[[ ... ]]` construct itself).
