Pattern: Use of legacy `` `STATEMENT` ``

Issue: -

## Description

Backtick command substitution `` `STATEMENT` `` is legacy syntax with several issues.

1. It has a series of undefined behaviors related to quoting in POSIX.
2. It imposes a custom escaping mode with surprising results.
3. It's exceptionally hard to nest.

`$(STATEMENT)` command substitution has none of these problems, and is therefore strongly encouraged.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
echo "Current time: `date`"
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
echo "Current time: $(date)"
```
