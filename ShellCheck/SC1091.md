Pattern: Not following file

Issue: -

## Description

ShellCheck, for whichever reason, is not able to access the source file.

This could be because you did not include it on the command line, did not use `shellcheck -x` to allow following other files, don't have permissions or a variety of other problems.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
source somefile
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
# shellcheck disable=SC1091
source somefile
```
