Pattern: Use of `-exec` to invoke a shell

Issue: -

## Description

find `-exec` and `-execdir` uses `execve(2)` style semantics, meaning it expects an executable and zero or more arguments that should be passed to it.

It does not use `system(3)` style semantics, meaning it does not accept a shell command as a string, to be parsed and evaluated by the system's command interpreter.

If you want `find` to execute a shell command, you have to specify `sh` (or `bash`) as the executable, `-c` as first argument and your shell command as the second.

To prevent command injection, the filename can be passed as a separate argument to sh and referenced as a positional parameter.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
find . -type f -exec 'cat {} | wc -l' \;
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
find . -type f -exec sh -c 'cat {} | wc -l' \;         # Insecure
find . -type f -exec sh -c 'cat "$1" | wc -l' _ {} \;  # Secure
```

Sometimes the command can also be rewritten to not require `find` to invoke a shell:

```sh
find . -type f -exec wc -l {} \; | cut -d ' ' -f 1
```

## Exceptions

This warning would trigger falsely if executing a program with spaces in the path, if no other arguments were specified.
