Pattern: Use of `elseif`/`elsif`

Issue: -

## Description

You appear to be using `elseif` or `elsif` as a keyword. This is not valid.

`sh` instead uses `elif` as its alternative branch keyword.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
if false
then
  echo "hi"
elseif true
then
  echo "ho"
fi
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
if false
then
  echo "hi"
elif true
then
  echo "ho"
fi
```
## Exceptions

If you have made your own function called `elseif` and intend to call it, you can ignore this message.
