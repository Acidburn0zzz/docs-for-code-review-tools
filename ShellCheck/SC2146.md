Pattern: Ignored values before `-o`

Issue: -

## Description

In `find`, two predicates with no operator between them is considered a logical, short-circuiting AND (as if using `-a`). E.g., `-name '*.mkv' -exec ..` is the same as `-name '*.mkv' -a -exec ..`.

`-a` has higher precedence than `-o`, so `-name '*.avi' -o -name '*.mkv' -a -exec ..` is equivalent to `-name '*.avi' -o \( -name '*.mkv' -a -exec .. \)`.


Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
find . -name '*.avi' -o -name '*.mkv' -exec cp {} /media \;
```

This means "if name matches `*.avi`, do nothing. Otherwise, if it matches `*.mkv`, execute a command.".

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
find . \( -name '*.avi' -o -name '*.mkv' \) -exec cp {} /media \;
```

We use `\( \)` to group to get the evaluation order we want. The correct code means "if name matches `*.avi` or `*.mkv`, then execute a command", which was what was intended.

## Exceptions

If you're aware of this, you can either ignore this error or group to make it explicit. For example, to decompress all gz files except tar.gz, you can use:

```sh
find . -name '*.tar.gz' -o \( -name '*.gz' -exec gzip -d {} + \)
```
