Pattern: Use of `$((..))`

Issue: -

## Description

`$((..))` expands to a number. If it's the only word on the line, the shell will try to execute this number as a command name:

```sh
$ i=4
$ $(( i++ ))
4: command not found
$ echo $i
5
```

To avoid trying to execute the number as a command name, use one of the methods mentioned:

```sh
$ i=4
$ _=$(( i++ ))
$ echo $i
5
```

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
i=4
$(( i++ ))
```

Example of **correct** code:

Bash, Ksh:

```sh
i=4
(( i++ ))
```

POSIX (assuming `++` is supported):

```sh
i=4
_=$(( i++ ))
```

Alternative POSIX version that does not preserve the exit code:

```sh
: $(( i++ ))
```
