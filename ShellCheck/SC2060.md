Pattern: Use of unquoted `tr` parameter

Issue: -

## Description

`[:digit:]` is a shell glob that matches any single character file named e.g. `g` or `t` in the current directory. Quoting it prevents the script from breaking in directories with files like this.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
tr -cd [:digit:]
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
tr -cd '[:digit:]'
```
