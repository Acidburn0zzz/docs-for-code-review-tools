Pattern: Use of `~` in quotes

Issue: -

## Description

Tilde does not expand to the user's home directory when it's single or double quoted. Use double quotes and `$HOME` instead.

Alternatively, the `~/` can be left unquoted, as in `rm ~/"Desktop/$filename"`.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
rm "~/Desktop/$filename"
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
rm "$HOME/Desktop/$filename"
```

## Exceptions

If you don't want the tilde to be expanded, you can ignore this message.
