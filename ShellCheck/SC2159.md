Pattern: Use of `[ 0 ]` instead of `false`

Issue: -

## Description

`[ str ]` checks whether `str` is non-empty. It doesn't matter if `str` is `0`, it will still be evaluated for non-emptiness.

Instead, use the command `false` which -- as the manual puts it -- does nothing, unsuccessfully.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
if [ 0 ]
then
  echo "always triggers"
fi
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
if false
then
  echo "never triggers"
fi
```
