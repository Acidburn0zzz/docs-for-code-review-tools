Pattern: Whitespace between `#` and `!` in the shebang

Issue: -

## Description

The script has spaces between the `#` and `!` in the shebang. This is not valid.

Remove the spaces so the OS can correctly recognize the file as a script.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
# !/bin/sh
echo "Hello World"
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
echo "Hello World"
```
