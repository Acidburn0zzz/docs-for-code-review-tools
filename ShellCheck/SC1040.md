Pattern: Use of `<<-` with space indentation

Issue: -

## Description

`<<-`, by design, only strips tabs. Not spaces.

Your editor may be automatically replacing tabs with spaces, either when you type them or when you save the file or both.

Example of **incorrect** code:

Any code using `<<-` that is indented with spaces. `cat -T script` shows

```sh
    cat <<- foo
        Hello world
    foo
```

Example of **correct** code:

Code using `<<-` must be indented with tabs. `cat -T script` shows

```sh
^Icat <<- foo
^I^IHello world
^Ifoo
```

Or simply don't indent the end token:

```sh
    cat <<- foo
      Hello World
foo
```
