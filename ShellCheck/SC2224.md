Pattern: Use of `mv` without destination

Issue: -

## Description

This may be because the source and destination was accidentally merged into a single argument, or because the line was broken in an invalid way.

Fix the `mv` statement by correctly specifying both source and destination.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
mv "$file $dir"
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
mv "$file" "$dir"
```
