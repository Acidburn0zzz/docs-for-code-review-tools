Pattern: Missing space before `=`

Issue: -

## Description

You appear to be missing the space on the left side of the operator. Shell in general, and `[` in particular, is space sensitive. Operators and operands must be separate tokens. 

Please ensure that the operator, like the `=` in the example, has a space both before and after it.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
[ "$var"= 2 ]
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
[ "$var" = 2 ]
```
## Exceptions

None. If you're comparing values in C style reverse order like `[ -eq == $1 ]`, use quotes: `[ "-eq" == "$1" ]`. Also, it's pointless since `[ a = b ]` doesn't assign.
