Pattern: Leading whitespace before the shebang

Issue: -

## Description

The script has leading spaces before the shebang (`#!`). This is not allowed. 

The `#!` should be the first two bytes in the file, as they're used as a file signature by the OS to determine whether a file is a script.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
  #!/bin/sh
echo "Hello world"
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
echo "Hello World"
```
