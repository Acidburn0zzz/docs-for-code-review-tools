Pattern: Unexpected `|`/`||`/`&&` at line start

Issue: -

## Description

ShellCheck has found a line that unexpectedly started with `|`, `||` or `&&`. This usually happens when a line is broken incorrectly.

When breaking around a `|`, `||` or `&&`, there are two options:

* Break the line *after* this token. `dmesg` is a complete command by itself, but `dmesg |` is not so the shell knows to continue on the next line.
* Use a `\` at the end of the previous line to explicitly tell the shell to continue on the next.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
dmesg
  | grep "error"
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
dmesg |
