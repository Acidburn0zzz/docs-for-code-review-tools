Pattern: Malformed `exit`

Issue: -

## Description

`exit` can only be used to signal success or failure (0 = success, 1-255 = failure). It can not be used to return string data, and it can not be used to print error messages.

String data should be written stdout, before an `exit 0` to exit with success.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
exit "Bad filename"
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
echo "Bad filename" >&2
exit 1
```
