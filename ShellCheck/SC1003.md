Pattern: Unescaped single quote in shell script

Issue: -

## Description

In POSIX shell, the shell cares about nothing but another single quote to terminate the quoted segment. Not even backslashes are interpreted.

Enclosing characters in single-quotes ( `''` ) shall preserve the literal value of each character within the single-quotes. A single-quote cannot occur within single-quotes.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
echo 'This is not how it\'s done'.
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
echo 'This is how it'\''s done'.
```

## Exceptions

If you want your single quoted string to end in a backslash, you can rewrite as `'string'\\` or ignore this warning.
