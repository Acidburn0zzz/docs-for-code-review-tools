Pattern: Use of quotes for right side of `=~`

Issue: -

## Description

Quotes on the right hand side of `=~` can be used to match literally, so that `[[ $1 =~ ^"$2".* ]]` works even if `$2` contains regex meta-characters. This mirrors the behavior of globs, `[[ $1 = "$2"* ]]`.

This also means that the problematic code tries to match literal carets and plus signs instead of interpreting them as regular expression matchers.  To match as a regex, the regex meta-characters it must be unquoted. Literal parts of the expression can be quoted with double or single quotes, or escaped.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
[[ $foo =~ "^fo+ bar$" ]]
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
[[ $foo =~ ^fo+\ bar$ ]]
```

## Exceptions

If you do want to match literally just to do a plain substring search, e.g. `[[ $foo =~ "bar" ]]`, you could ignore this message, but consider using a more canonical glob match instead: `[[ $foo = *"bar"* ]]`.
