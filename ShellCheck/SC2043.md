Pattern: Looping over single, constant value

Issue: -

## Description

This rule checks for loops that iterate over a single, constant value. This is most likely a bug in your code, caused not expanding the value in the way you want.

You should make sure that whatever you loop over will expand into multiple words.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
for var in value
do
  echo "$var"
done
```

Example of **correct** code:

Correct code depends on what you want to do.

To iterate over files in a directory, instead of `for var in /some/dir` use:

```sh
for var in /some/dir/* ; do echo "$var"; done
```

To iterate over lines in a file or command output, use a while read loop instead:

```sh
somecommand | while IFS= read -r line; do echo "$line"; done
```

To iterate over *words* written to a command or function's stdout, instead of `for var in somefunction`, use

```sh
for var in $(somefunction); do echo "$var"; done
```

To iterate over *words* in a variable, instead of  `for var in somevariable`, use

```sh
for var in $somevariable; do echo "$var"; done
```
