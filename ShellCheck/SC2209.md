Pattern: Missing use of `var=$(command)`

Issue: -

## Description

Putting `var=` in front of a command will not assign its output. Use `var=$(my command here)` to execute the command and capture its output.

If you do want to assign a literal string, use quotes to make this clear to ShellCheck and humans alike. 

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
user=whoami         # Want to run whoami and assign output

PAGER=cat git log   # Want to assign the string "cat"
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
user=$(whoami)

PAGER="cat" git log
```

## Exceptions

None. 

Quoting a single command (as in `PAGER="cat"` above) doesn't change how the script works. It's purely to show shellcheck (and humans) that a literal assignment of a command name is intentional. 

This warning triggers generally when a variable is assigned an unquoted command name (from a list of hard coded names).
