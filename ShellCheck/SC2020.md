Pattern: Use of `tr` with duplicate characters

Issue: -

## Description

`tr` is for `tr`ansliteration, turning some characters into other characters. It doesn't match strings or words, only individual characters.

The solution is to use a tool that does string search and replace, such as sed.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
echo 'hello world' | tr 'hello' 'goodbye'
```

In this case, it transliterates h->g, e->o, l->d, o->y, resulting in the string "goddb wbrdd" instead of "goodbye world".

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
echo 'hello world' | sed -e 's/hello/goodbye/g'
```
