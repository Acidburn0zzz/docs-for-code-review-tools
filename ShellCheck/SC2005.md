Pattern: Unnecessary `echo`

Issue: -

## Description

The command substitution `$(foo)` yields the result of command `foo` with trailing newlines erased, and when it is passed to `echo` it generally just gives the same result as `foo`.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
echo "$(cat 1.txt)"
echo `< /dev/urandom tr -dc _A-Z-a-z-0-9 | head -c6`
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
cat 1.txt # In bash, but faster and still sticks exactly one newline: printf '%s\n' "$(<1.txt)"
# The original `echo` sticks a newline; we want it too.
< /dev/urandom tr -dc _A-Z-a-z-0-9 | head -c6; echo
```
