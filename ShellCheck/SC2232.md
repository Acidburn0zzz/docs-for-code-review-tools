Pattern: Invalid argument to `sudo`

Issue: -

## Description

Due to the Unix process model, `sudo` can only change the privileges of a new, external process. It cannot grant privileges to a currently running process.

This means that shell builtins - commands that are interpreted by the current shell rather than through program invocation - cannot be run with `sudo`. This includes `cd`, `source`, `read`, and others.

Instead you can run a shell with `sudo`, and have that shell run the builtins you want:

    sudo sh -c 'cd /root && pwd'  # This shows /root
    pwd                           # This shows the original directory

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
sudo cd /root
pwd
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
sudo sh -c 'cd /root && pwd'
```
