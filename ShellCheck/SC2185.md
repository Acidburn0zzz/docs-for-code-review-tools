Pattern: Use of `find` without search path

Issue: -

## Description

When not provided a search path, GNU and Busybox `find` will use a default path of `.`, the current directory.

On POSIX, macOS/OSX, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD, it will instead result in an error.

Explicitly specifying a path works across all implementations, and is therefore preferred.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
find -type f
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
find . -type f
```
## Exceptions

You will get a false positive if you concatenate a series of pre-path flags:

    find -XLE .

In such cases, please either use `find -X -L -E .` or ignore the message.
