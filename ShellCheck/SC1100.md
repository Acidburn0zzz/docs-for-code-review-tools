Pattern: Use of Unicode dash

Issue: -

## Description

A character that looks similar to `-` has made its way into your code. To fix it, simply delete and retype it as ASCII.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
[[ 3 â€“gt 2 ]] # Uses unicode en-dash character
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
[[ 3 -gt 2 ]] # Uses regular ASCII hyphen-minus character
```

## Exceptions

None. Use quotes if you want a literal Unicode dash character.
