Pattern: Missing space before `:`

Issue: -

## Description

`:` is a synonym for `true`, the command that "does nothing, successfully", and as a command name it needs a space. 

`do:` is as invalid as `dotrue`. Use `do :`, or preferably, `do true` for readability.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
until make
do:; done
```
