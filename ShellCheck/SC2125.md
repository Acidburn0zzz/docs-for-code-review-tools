Pattern: Malformed brace expansion in assignment

Issue: -

## Description

`echo *.png {1..9}` expands to all png files and numbers from 1 to 9, but `var=*.png` or `var={1..9}` will just assign the literal strings `'*.png'` and `'{1..9}'`.

To make the variable contain all png files or 1 through 9, use an array as demonstrated.

If you intended to assign these values as literals, quote them (e.g. `var="*.png"`).

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
foo={1..9}
echo $foo
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
foo=( {1..9} )
echo "${foo[@]}"
```
