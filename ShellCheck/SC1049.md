Pattern: Missing `then` for `if` or `elif`

Issue: -

## Description

Your code probably has a missing `then` keyword for the `if` or `elif`.

Note that the `then` needs a `;` or linefeed before it. `if true then` is invalid, while `if true; then` is correct.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
if true
  echo "foo"
elif true
  echo "bar"
fi
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
if true
then
  echo "foo"
elif true
then
  echo "bar"
fi
```
