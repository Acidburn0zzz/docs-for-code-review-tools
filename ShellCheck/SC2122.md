Pattern: Use of unsupported `<=`/`>=` in shell script

Issue: -

## Description

The operators `<=` and `>=` are not supported by Bourne shells. Instead of "less than or equal", rewrite as "not greater than".

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
[[ a &lt;= b ]]
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
[[ ! a > b ]]
```
