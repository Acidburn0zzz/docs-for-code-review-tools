Pattern: Ungrouped `>>` redirects

Issue: -

## Description

Rather than adding `>> something` after every single line, you can simply group the relevant commands and redirect the group.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
echo foo >> file
date >> file
cat stuff  >> file

```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
{
  echo foo
