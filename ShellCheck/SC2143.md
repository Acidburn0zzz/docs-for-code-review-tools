Pattern: Missing use of `grep -q`

Issue: -

## Description

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
if [ "$(find . | grep 'IMG[0-9]')" ]
then
  echo "Images found"
fi
```

The problematic code has to iterate the entire directory and read all matching lines into memory before making a decision.

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
if find . | grep -q 'IMG[0-9]'
then
  echo "Images found"
fi
```

The correct code is cleaner and stops at the first matching line, avoiding both iterating the rest of the directory and reading data into memory.

## Exceptions

The `pipefail` bash option may interfere with this rewrite, since the `if` will now in effect be evaluating the statuses of all commands instead of just the last one. Be careful using them together.
