Pattern: Use of `&`, `;`, `&>` or similar after a here-document

Issue: -

## Description

You are using `&`, `;`, `&>` or similar after a here-document. This is not allowed. This should instead be part of the line that initiated the here-document, i.e. the one with the `<<`. 

If it helps, look at `<< "END"` as if it was `< file`, and make sure the resulting command is valid. This is what the shell does. You can then append here-document data after the command.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
sudo bash -s << "END"
  cmd1
  cmd2
END &

```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
sudo bash -s << "END" &
  cmd1
  cmd2
END
```
