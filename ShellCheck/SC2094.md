Pattern: Reading and writing same file in the pipeline

Issue: -

## Description

Each step in a pipeline runs in parallel.

In this case, `grep foo file.txt` will immediately try to read `file.txt` while `sed .. > file.txt` will immediately try to truncate it.

This is a race condition, and results in the file being partially or (far more likely) entirely truncated.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
grep foo file.txt | sed -e 's/foo/bar/g' > file.txt
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
grep foo file.txt  | sed -e 's/foo/bar/g' > tmpfile && mv tmpfile file.txt
```

## Exceptions

You can ignore this error if:

* The file is a device or named pipe. These files don't truncate in the same way.
* The command mentions the filename but doesn't read/write it, such as `echo log.txt > log.txt`.
