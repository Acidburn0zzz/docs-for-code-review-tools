Pattern: Ambiguous _Bash_ prompt

Issue: -

## Description

Bash is unable to determine exactly which parts of your prompt are text and which are terminal codes. You have to help it by wrapping invisible control codes in `\[..\]` (and ensuring that visible characters are not wrapped in `\[..\]`).

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
PS1='\e[36m\$ \e(B\e[m'
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
PS1='\[\e[36m\]\$ \[\e(B\e[m\]'
```
