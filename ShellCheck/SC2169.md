Pattern: Use of unsupported `[[ .. ]]` for `dash`

Issue: -

## Description

You are writing a script for `dash`, but you're using a feature that `dash` doesn't support (in this case, bash/ksh style `[[ .. ]]` conditions). 

See Ubuntu's [DashAsBinSh](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DashAsBinSh) migration guide for how to make bash-specific scripts dash-compatible.
