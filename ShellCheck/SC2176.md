Pattern: Use of `time` with pipeline

Issue: -

## Description

This behavior is explicitly left undefined [in POSIX](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/time.html).

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
time foo | bar```

Example of **correct** code:

To time the most relevant stage:

```sh
foo | { time bar; }
```

To time everything in a pipeline:

```sh
time bash -c 'foo | bar'
```

Note that you can not `time sh -c` to time an entire pipeline, because POSIX does not guarantee that anything other than the last stage is waited on and therefore be recursively counted in the `times()` call that `time` depends on.

## Exceptions

None. This method is not given in `ksh` or `bash` where `time` is defined for pipelines.
