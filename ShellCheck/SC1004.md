Pattern: Use of literal backslash followed by linefeed

Issue: -

## Description

You have a single quoted string containing a backslash followed by a linefeed (newline). Unlike double quotes or unquoted strings, this has no special meaning. The string will contain a literal backslash and a linefeed.

If you wanted to break the line but not add a linefeed to the string, stop the single quote, break the line, and reopen it. This is demonstrated in the correct code.

If you wanted to break the line and also include the linefeed as a literal, you don't need a backslash:

```
var='This is a multi-line string
with an embedded linefeed'
```


Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
var='This is long \
piece of text'
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
var='This is a long '\
'piece of text'
```
## Exceptions

If you do want a string containing a literal backslash+linefeed combo, such as with `sed`, you can ignore this warning.
