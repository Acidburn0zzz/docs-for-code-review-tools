Pattern: Overwriting _PATH_ in shell script

Issue: -

## Description

`PATH` is where the shell looks for the commands it executes. By inadvertently overwriting it, the shell will be unable to find commands (like `cat` in this case).

You get this warning when ShellCheck suspects that you didn't meant to overwrite it (because it's a single path with no path separators).

Best shell scripting practice is to always use lowercase variable names to avoid accidentally overwriting exported and internal variables.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
PATH=/some/dir
cat "$PATH/file"
```

Example of **correct** code:

Good practice: always use lowercase for unexported variables.

```sh
path=/some/dir
cat "$path/file"
```

Bad practice: use another uppercase name.

```sh
MYPATH=/some/dir
cat "$MYPATH/file"
```

## Exceptions

If you're aware of the above and really do want to set your shell search path to `/some/dir`, you can ignore this warning.
