Pattern: Constant `[ .. ]` or `[[ .. ]]` comparison

Issue: -

## Description

This rule checks for `[ .. ]` or `[[ .. ]]` comparison that only involves literal strings. The intention was probably to check a variable or command output instead.

This is usually due to missing `$` or bad quoting:

    if [[ "somevar" = "test" ]]             # always false because somevar is a literal string
    if [[ "$somevar" = "test" ]]            # correctly compares a variable

    if [ 'grep -c foo bar' -ge 10 ]       # always false because grep doesn't run
    if [ "$(grep -c foo bar)" -ge 10 ]    # correctly checks grep output

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
if [ somevar = "test" ]
then
  echo "Test mode"
fi
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
if [ "$somevar" = "test" ]
then
  echo "Test mode"
fi
```
