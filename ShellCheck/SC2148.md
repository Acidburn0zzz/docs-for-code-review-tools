Pattern: Missing target shell for _Bash_ script

Issue: -

## Description

Different shells support different features. To give effective advice, ShellCheck needs to know which shell your script is going to run on. You will get a different numbers of warnings about different things depending on your target shell.

ShellCheck normally determines your target shell from the shebang (having e.g. `#!/bin/sh` as the first line). The shell can also be specified from the CLI with `-s`, e.g. `shellcheck -s sh file`.

If you don't specify shebang nor `-s`, ShellCheck gives this message and proceeds with some default (`bash`).

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
echo "$RANDOM"   # Does this work?
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
echo "$RANDOM"  # Unsupported in sh. Produces warning.
```

or

```sh
#!/bin/bash
echo "$RANDOM"  # Supported in bash. No warnings.
```
