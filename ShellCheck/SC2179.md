Pattern: Trying to append a string to array with `var+=string`

Issue: -

## Description

It looks like you are trying to append a string to an array with `var+=string`. This instead appends to the first element of the array (equivalent to `var[0]+=three`).

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
var=(one two)
var+=three
```

Here the array will contain `onethree` `two`.

Instead, append an array to the array with `var+=( elements )`. This will append the new items to the array.

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
var=(one two)
var+=( three )
```
## Exceptions

If ShellCheck mistakenly thinks the variable is an array when it's not (e.g. because the same name was used in a different context), you can ignore this error.
