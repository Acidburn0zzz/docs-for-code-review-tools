Pattern: Missing expansion quoting in `for` loop glob

Issue: -

## Description

When iterating over globs containing expansions, you can still quote all expansions in the path to better handle whitespace and special characters.

Make sure glob characters are outside quotes. `"$dir/*.txt"` will not glob expand, but `"$dir"/*.txt` or `"$dir"/*."$ext"` will. 

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
for file in $dir/*.txt
do
  echo "Found $file"
done
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
for file in "$dir"/*.txt
do
  echo "Found $file"
done
```

## Exceptions

If the variable is expected to contain globs, such as if `dir="tmp/**"` in the example, you can ignore this message.
