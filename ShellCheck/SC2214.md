Pattern: Redundant `getopts` flag

Issue: -

## Description

You have a `case` statement in a `while getopts` loop that matches a flag that hasn't been provided in the `getopts` option string.

Either add the flag to the options list, or delete the case statement.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
while getopts "vr" n
do
  case "$n" in
    v) echo "Verbose" ;;
    r) echo "Recursive" ;;
    n) echo "Dry-run" ;;
    *) usage;;
  esac
done
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
while getopts "vrn" n    # 'n' added here
do
  case "$n" in
    v) echo "Verbose" ;;
    r) echo "Recursive" ;;
    n) echo "Dry-run" ;;
    *) usage;;
  esac
done
```
