Pattern: Use of `[]` around range in `tr`

Issue: -

## Description

Ancient System V `tr` required brackets around operands, but modern implementations including POSIX, GNU, OS X and *BSD instead treat them as literals.

Unless you want to operate on literal square brackets, don't include them.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
tr -cd '[a-z]'
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
tr -cd 'a-z'
```
## Exceptions

If you do want to replace literal square brackets, reorder the expression (e.g. `a-z[]` to make it clear that the brackets are not special).

ShellCheck does not warn about correct usage of `[..]` in character and equivalence classes like `[:lower:]` and `[=e=]`.
