Pattern: Word is outside of quotes in shell script

Issue: -

## Description

There is no way to nest single quotes. However, single quotes can be placed literally in double quotes, so you can instead concatenate a single quoted string and a double quoted string.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
#                   v---match--v
alias server_uptime='ssh $host 'uptime -p''
#                                        ^^
```

This is the same thing as `alias server_uptime='ssh $host uptime' -p`.

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
#                   v--match---v
alias server_uptime='ssh $host '"'uptime -p'"
#                               ^---match---^ 
```

This results in an alias with embedded single quotes.
