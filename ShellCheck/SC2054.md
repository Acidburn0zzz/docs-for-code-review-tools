Pattern: Use of `,` to separate _Bash_ array elements

Issue: -

## Description

You appear to have used commas to separate array elements in an array assignment. Other languages require this, but _Bash_ instead treats the commas as literal strings.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
flags=("-l", "-d", "--sort=size")
ls "${flags[@]}"
```

The first element is `-l,` with the trailing comma, and the executed command ends up being `ls -l, -d, --sort=size`.

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
flags=("-l" "-d" "--sort=size")
ls "${flags[@]}"
```

The trailing commas have been removed, and the command will be `ls -l -d --sort=size` as expected.
