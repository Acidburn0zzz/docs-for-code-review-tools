Pattern: Malformed `exit` arguments

Issue: -

## Description

In bash, `exit` can only be used to signal success or failure (0 = success, 1-255 = failure).

To exit with textual or multiple values from a function, write them to stdout and capture them with command substitution instead.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
exit one two
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
echo one
echo two
exit
```
