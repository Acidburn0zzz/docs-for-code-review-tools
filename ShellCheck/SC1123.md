Pattern: Invalid `shellcheck` directive for non-command keyword

Issue: -

## Description

You appear to have put a directive before a non-command keyword, such as `elif`, `else`, `do`, `;;` or similar. 

ShellCheck comment directives apply to the next shell command, rather than to the next line of text. This means that you can put a directive in front of a `while` loop, `if` statement or function definition, and it will apply to that entire structure.

However, it also means that you cannot apply the directive to non-commands like an individual `elif` or `else` block since these are not commands by themselves, and rather just parts of an `if` compound command.

Please move the directive in front of the nearest applicable command that contains the code you want to apply it to, such as before the `if`. 

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
if [ "$prod" = "true" ]
then
  echo "Prod mode"
# shellcheck disable=2154
elif [ "$debug" = "true" ]
then
  echo "Debug mode"
fi
```

Example of **correct** code:
```sh
# Applies to entire `if...fi` command
# shellcheck disable=2154
if [ "$prod" = "true" ]
then
  echo "Prod mode"
elif [ "$debug" = "true" ]
then
  echo "Debug mode"
fi
```

or 

```sh
if [ "$prod" = "true" ]
then
  echo "Prod mode"
elif  # Applies only to this [ .. ] command
      # shellcheck disable=2154
      [ "$debug" = "true" ]
then
  echo "Debug mode"
fi
```
