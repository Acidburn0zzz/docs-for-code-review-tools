Pattern: Use of non-standard `which`

Issue: -

## Description

`which` is a non-standard, external tool that locates an executable in PATH. `command -v` is a POSIX standard builtin, which uses the same lookup mechanism that the shell itself would.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
which grep
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
command -v grep
```
