Pattern: Missing `$` for `$((..))` expression

Issue: -

## Description

You appear to be missing the `$` on an assignment from an arithmetic expression `var=$((..))`.

Without the `$`, this is an array expression which is either nested (ksh) or invalid (bash). 

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
var=((foo+1))
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
var=$((foo+1))
```

## Exceptions

If you are trying to define a multidimensional Ksh array, add spaces between the `( (` to clarify:

    var=( (1 2 3) (4 5 6) )
