Pattern: Improperly terminated here-document

Issue: -

## Description

Your here-document isn't properly terminated.

Look at here-document and see which line was supposed to terminate it. Then ensure it matches the token exactly, and that it's on its own line with no text before or after.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
cat <<-eof
Hello World
-eof
```

In the example code, the script uses `<<-eof`, which is the operator `<<-` followed by `eof`. The script therefore looks for `eof` and skips right past the intended terminator because it starts with a dash.

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
cat <<- eof
Hello World
eof
```
