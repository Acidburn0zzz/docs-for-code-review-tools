Pattern: Malformed shebang

Issue: -

## Description

You appear to be specifying a shebang, but missing the bang (i.e. `!`). The shebang should always be on the form `#!/path/shell`.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
# /bin/bash
echo "Hello World"
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
#! /bin/bash
echo "Hello World"
```
