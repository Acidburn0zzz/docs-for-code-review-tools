Pattern: Use of `ln` without destination

Issue: -

## Description

This may be because the source and destination was accidentally merged into a single argument, because the line was broken in an invalid way, or because you're using a non-standard invocation of `ln` that defaults to linking the argument into the current directory.

If you wanted to specify both source and destination, fix the `ln` statement.

If you wanted to link a file into the current directory, prefer using the more explicit and POSIX standard invocation `ln /your/file .` 

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
ln "$file $dir"
```

or

```sh
ln /foo/bar/baz
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
ln "$file" "$dir"
```

or

```sh
ln /foo/bar/baz .
```
