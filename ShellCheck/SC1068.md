Pattern: Use of spaces around `=` in assignment

Issue: -

## Description

Shells are space sensitive. `foo=42` means to assign `42` to the variable `foo`. `foo = 42` means to run a command named `foo`, and pass `=` as `$1` and `42` as `$2`.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
foo = 42
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
foo=42
```

## Exceptions

If you actually wanted to run a command named foo and provide `=` as the first argument, simply quote it: `foo "=" 42`.
