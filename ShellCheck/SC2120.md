Pattern: Function references argument, but none are ever passed

Issue: -

## Description

In a function, `$1` and up refers to the function's parameters, not the script's parameters.

If you want to process your script's parameters in a function, you have to explicitly pass them. You can do this with `somefunction "$@"`.

Note that `"$@"` refers to the current context's positional parameters, so if you call a function from a function, you have to pass in `"$@"` to both of them:

```sh
first() { second "$@"; }
second() { echo "The first script parameter is: $1"; }
first "$@"
```

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
sayhello() {
  echo "Hello $1"
}
sayhello
```

`./somescript World` just prints "Hello " instead of "Hello World".

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
sayhello() {
  echo "Hello $1"
}
sayhello "$@"
```

`./somescript World` now prints "Hello World".

## Exceptions

If the parameters are optional and you currently just don't want to use them, you can ignore this message.
