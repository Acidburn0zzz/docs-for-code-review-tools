Pattern: Missing spaces around `=`

Issue: -

## Description

`[[ 0 = 1 ]]` means "check if 0 and 1 are equal".

`[[ str ]]` is short form for `[[ -n str ]]`, and means "check if `str` is non-empty". It doesn't matter if `str` happens to contain `0=1`.

Always use spaces around the comparison operator in `[..]` and `[[..]]`, otherwise it won't be recognized as an operator.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
[[ 0=1 ]]
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
[[ 0 = 1 ]]
```
