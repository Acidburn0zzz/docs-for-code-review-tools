Pattern: Use of `break`/`continue` outside a loop

Issue: -

## Description

These statements are only valid in loops. In particular, `break` is not required in `case` statements as there is no implicit fall-through.

To return from a function or sourced script, use `return`. To exit a script, use `exit`.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
case "$1" in
    -v)
       verbose=1
       break
       ;;
    -d)
       debug=1
esac
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
case "$1" in
    -v)
       verbose=1
       ;;
    -d)
       debug=1
esac
```

## Exceptions

It's possible to `break`/`continue` in a function without a loop. The call will then affect the loop -- if any -- that the function is invoked from.
