Pattern: Use of unquoted `grep` pattern

Issue: -

## Description

The regex passed to grep frequently contains characters that collide with globs. The code above is supposed to match "f followed by 1 or more o's", but if the directory contains a file called "foo.txt", an unquoted pattern will cause it to become `grep foo.txt file`.

To prevent this, always quote the regex passed to grep, especially when it contains one or more glob character.

Example of **incorrect** code:

    grep foo* file

Example of **correct** code:

    grep "foo*" file
