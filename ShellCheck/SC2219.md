Pattern: Use of `let expr` instead of `(( expr ))` 

Issue: -

## Description

The `(( .. ))` arithmetic compound command evaluates expressions in the same way as `let`, except it's not subject to glob expansion and therefore requires no additional quoting or escaping. 

This warning only triggers in Bash/Ksh scripts. In Sh/Dash, neither `let` nor `(( .. ))` are defined, but can be simulated with `[ $(( expr )) -ne 0 ]` to retain exit code, or `: $(( expr ))` to ignore it.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
let a++
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
(( a++ ))
```
