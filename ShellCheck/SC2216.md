Pattern: Piping to command that does not read from _stdin_

Issue: -

## Description

You are piping to one of several commands that don't read from _stdin_.

This may happen when:

* Confusing one command for another, e.g. using `echo` where `cat` was intended.
* Incorrectly refactoring, leaving a `|` on the previous line.
* Missing `xargs`, because _stdin_ should be passed as positional parameters instead (use `xargs -0` if at all possible).

Check your logic, and rewrite the command so data is passed correctly.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
ls | echo                      # Want to print result
cat files | rm                 # Want to delete items from a file
find . -type f | xargs cp dir  # Want to process 'find' output
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
ls
cat files | while IFS= read -r file; do rm -- "$file"; done
find . -type f -exec cp {} dir \;
```

## Exceptions

If you've overridden a command to return output, you can either rename it to make this obvious, or ignore this message.
