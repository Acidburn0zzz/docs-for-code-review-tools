Pattern: Use of `return` with multiple values

Issue: -

## Description

In bash, `return` can only be used to signal success or failure (0 = success, 1-255 = failure).

To return textual or multiple values from a function, write them to stdout and capture them with command substitution instead.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
somefunc() {
  return foo bar
}
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
somefunc() {
  echo foo
  echo bar
  return 0
}
```
