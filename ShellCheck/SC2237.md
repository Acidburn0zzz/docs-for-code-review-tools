Pattern: Use of `! [ -z .. ]` instead of `[ -n .. ]`

Issue: -

## Description

You have negated `test -z` or `test -n`, resulting in a needless double-negative. You can just use the other operator instead:

    # Identical tests to verify that a value is assigned
    ! [ -z foo ] # Not has no value
    [ -n foo ]   # Has value

    # Identical tests to verify that a value is empty
    ! [ -n foo ] # Not is non-empty
    [ -z foo ]   # Is empty

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
if ! [ -n "$JAVA_HOME" ]; then echo "JAVA_HOME not specified"; fi
if ! [ -z "$STY" ];       then echo "You are already running screen"; fi
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
if [ -z "$JAVA_HOME" ]; then echo "JAVA_HOME not specified"; fi
if [ -n "$STY" ];       then echo "You are already running screen"; fi
```

## Exceptions

This is a stylistic issue that does not affect correctness. If you prefer the original expression, you can ignore it with a directive or flag.
