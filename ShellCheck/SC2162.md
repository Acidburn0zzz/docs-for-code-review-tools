Pattern: Use of `read` without `-r`

Issue: -

## Description

By default, `read` will interpret backslashes before spaces and line feeds, and otherwise strip them. This is rarely expected or desired.

Normally you just want to read data, which is what `read -r` does. You should always use `-r` unless you have a good reason not to.

Note that `read -r` will still strip leading and trailing spaces. `IFS="" read -r` prevents this.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
echo "Enter name:"
read name
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
echo "Enter name:"
read -r name
```
