Pattern: Expanding array without an index

Issue: -

## Description

When referencing arrays, `$somearray` is equivalent to `${somearray[0]}` -- it results in only the first of multiple elements.

To get all elements as separate parameters, use the index `@` (and make sure to double quote). In the example, `echo "${somearray[@]}"` is equivalent to `echo "foo" "bar"`.

To get all elements as a single parameter, concatenated by the first character in `IFS`, use the index `*`. In the example, `echo "${somearray[*]}"` is equivalent to `echo "foo bar"`.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
somearray=(foo bar)
for f in $somearray
do
  cat "$f"
done
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
somearray=(foo bar)
for f in "${somearray[@]}"
do
  cat "$f"
done
```
