Pattern: Use of `expr`

Issue: -

## Description

`expr` utility has a rather difficult syntax. In many cases, the arithmetic and string features provided as part of the shell command language are easier to use than their equivalents in `expr`. Newly written scripts should avoid `expr` in favor of the new features within the shell.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
i=$(expr 1 + 2)
l=$(expr length "$var")
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
i=$((1+2))
l=${#var}
```

## Exceptions

`sh` doesn't have a great replacement for the `:` operator (regex match). ShellCheck tries not to warn when using expr with `:`, but e.g. `op=:; expr string "$op" regex` will still trigger it.

Other than that, all uses of `expr` can be rewritten to use modern shell features instead.

Bash has `[[ string =~ regex ]]`, so not even `expr .. : ..` is necessary.
