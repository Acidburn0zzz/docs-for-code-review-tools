Pattern: Grepping `ps` output instead of using `pgrep`

Issue: -

## Description

If you are just after a pid from a running program, then `pgrep` is a much safer alternative. Especially if you are also looking for a pid belonging to a certain user or group. All of the parameters are in one command and it can eliminate multiple greps, cuts, seds, awks, etc.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
ps ax | grep -v grep | grep "$service" > /dev/null
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
pgrep -f "$service" > /dev/null
```

## Exceptions

What if you have the pid and you are looking for the matching program name?

```sh
pid=123; ps ax | grep "$pid"
```

What if you want a range of the ps field, like from the 16th space to the end of the line?

```sh
ps ax | grep "$pid" | cut -d" " -f16-
```

Both are valid cases where this rule is not valid.
