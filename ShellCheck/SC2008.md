Pattern: Piping command output to `echo`

Issue: -

## Description

You are piping command output to `echo`, but `echo` ignores all piped input.

In particular, `echo` is not responsible for putting output on screen. Commands already output data, and with no further actions that will end up on screen.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
find . | echo
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
find .
```
