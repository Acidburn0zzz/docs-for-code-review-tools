Pattern: Escaped `(` or `)` in `[[..]]`

Issue: -

## Description

You don't have to `(` or `)` inside a `[[ .. ]]` expression like you do in `[ .. ]`. Just remove the escaping.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
[[ -e ~/.bashrc -a \( -x /bin/dash -o -x /bin/ash \) ]]
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
[[ -e ~/.bashrc -a ( -x /bin/dash -o -x /bin/ash ) ]]
```
