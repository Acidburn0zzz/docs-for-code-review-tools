Pattern: Use of confusing `A && B || C` in Shell script

Issue: -

## Description

It's common to use `A && B` to run `B` when `A` is true, and `A || C` to run `C` when `A` is false.

However, combining them into `A && B || C` is not the same as `if A then B else C`.

In this case, if `A` is true but `B` is false, `C` will run.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
[[ $dryrun ]] && echo "Would delete file" || rm file
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
if [[ $dryrun ]]
then
  echo "Would delete file"
else
  rm file
fi
```

## Exceptions

Ignore this warning when you actually do intend to run C when either A or B fails.
