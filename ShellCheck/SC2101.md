Pattern: Missing outer `[]` for named class

Issue: -

## Description

Predefined character groups are supposed to be used inside character ranges. `[:digit:]` matches one of "digt:" just like `[abc]` matches one of "abc". `[[:digit:]]` matches a digit.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
gzip file[:digit:]*.txt
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
gzip file[[:digit:]]*.txt
```

## Exceptions

When passing an argument to `tr` which parses these by itself without relying on globbing, you should quote it instead, e.g. `tr -d '[:digit:]'`
