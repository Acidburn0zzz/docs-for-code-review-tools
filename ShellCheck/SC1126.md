Pattern: Misplaced `shellcheck` directive

Issue: -

## Description

ShellCheck expects directives to come before the relevant command. They are not allowed after.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
var=1 # shellcheck disable=SC2034
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
# shellcheck disable=SC2034
var=1 
```
## Exceptions

If this is not a directive and just a comment mentioning ShellCheck, please rewrite or capitalize:

    var=1 # ShellCheck encourages lowercase variable names
