Pattern: Possibly dangerous use of `"$empty/"`

Issue: -

## Description

This rule is indented to detect some catastrophic `rm -r "$empty/"` mistakes.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
rm -rf "$STEAMROOT/"*
```

If `STEAMROOT` is empty, this will [end up deleting everything](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/3671) in the system's root directory.

Using `:?` will cause the command to fail if the variable is null or unset. Similarly, you can use `:-` to set a default value if applicable.

In the case command substitution, assign to a variable first and then use `:?`. This is relevant even if the command seems simple and obviously correct, since forks and execs can fail due to external system limits and conditions, resulting in a blank substitution.

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
rm -rf "${STEAMROOT:?}/"*
```
