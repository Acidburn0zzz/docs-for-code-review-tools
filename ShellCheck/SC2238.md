Pattern: Redirecting to/from command name

Issue: -

## Description

You are using file redirection, but the filename is an unquoted command name. Instead of running the command and feeding data to it, this just writes to a file with the same name. 

To run the command and feed data to it, determine how it gets its data:

* If the command reads from STDIN, simply use a pipe as in the first example.
* If the command reads multiple arguments, use a pipe to `xargs` as in the second example

Note that `xargs` has many pitfalls when it comes to spaces and quotes. `cat file | xargs rm`  will appear to work during testing, but fails for filenames like `My File.txt` or `Can't_Fight_This_Feeling.mp3`. The example uses the GNU extension `-d '\n'` to more safely handle these names. 

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
cat file > tr -d '\r'
cat file > rm
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
cat file | tr -d '\r'         # tr reads stdin
cat file | xargs -d '\n' rm   # rm reads arguments
```

## Exceptions

If you actually did want to write a file named after a command, simply quote the filename to let ShellCheck know you meant it literally and not as a command name. This does not change anything about how the script works:

```sh
# Write to a file literally named 'rm', does not try to delete anything
echo "A potentially dangerous command" > "rm" 
```
