Pattern: Initializing/appending array element to an associative array without index

Issue: -

## Description

You appear to be initializing or appending an array element to an associative array without giving it an index. In an indexed array, elements will be auto-indexed by incremented characters. In associative arrays, the index must be given explicitly.

This could happen because of invalid spaces or otherwise malformed index assignment, such as `array=( [key] = value )`. This should instead be `array=( [key]=value )`.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
declare -A foo
foo=( somevalue )
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
declare -A foo
foo=( [key]=somevalue )
```
