Pattern: Use of Unicode single quote

Issue: -

## Description

Some software, like OS X, Word and WordPress, may automatically replace your regular quotes with slanted Unicode quotes. The shell does not recognize these quotes and will not respect them.

In this case, you have slanted single quotes in a single quoted string. Try deleting and retyping them, and/or disable “smart quotes” in your editor or OS.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
echo 'hello world’
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
echo 'hello world'
```

## Exceptions

If you want to use literal slanted single quotes for typographic reasons, you can put them in double quotes to make ShellCheck ignore them:

```sh
printf "Warning: ‘wakeonlan’ is not installed.\\n"
```
