Pattern: Use of `local` for non-function

Issue: -

## Description

In Bash, `local` can only be used in functions. In other contexts, it's an error.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
local foo=bar
echo "$foo"
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
foo=bar
echo "$foo"
```
## Exceptions

It's possible to source files containing `local` from a function context but not from any other context. This is not good practice, but in these cases you can ignore this error.
