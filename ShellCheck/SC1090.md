Pattern: Can't follow non-constant source

Issue: -

## Description

ShellCheck is not able to include sourced files from paths that are determined at runtime. The file will not be read, potentially resulting in warnings about unassigned variables and similar.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
. "$(find_install_dir)/lib.sh"
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
# shellcheck source=src/lib.sh
. "$(find_install_dir)/lib.sh"
```

## Exceptions

If you don't care that ShellCheck is unable to account for the file, specify `# shellcheck source=/dev/null`.
