Pattern: Use of `echo` with escape sequence

Issue: -

## Description

Backslash escapes like `\t` and `\n` are not expanded by echo, and become literal backslash-t, backslash-n.

`printf` does expand these sequences, and should be used instead.

Other, non-portable methods include `echo -e '\t'` and `echo $'\t'`. This rule will warn if this is used in a script with shebang `#!/bin/sh`.

If you actually wanted a literal backslash-t, use

```sh
echo "\\t"
```

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
echo "Name:\t$value"
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
printf "Name:\t%s\n" "$value"
```
