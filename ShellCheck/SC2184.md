Pattern: Use of `unset` with unquoted argument

Issue: -

## Description

Arguments to `unset` are subject to regular glob expansion. This is especially relevant when unsetting indices in arrays, where `[..]` is considered a glob character group.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
unset foo[index]
```

Having a file called `food` in the current directory will result in `unset foo[index]` expanding to `unset food`, which will silently succeed without unsetting the element.

Quoting so that the `[..]` is passed literally to `unset` solves the issue.

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
unset 'foo[index]'
```
