Pattern: Use of `for` loop over `find` output

Issue: -

## Description

`for var in $(find ...)`  loops rely on word splitting and will evaluate globs, which will wreck havoc with filenames containing whitespace or glob characters.

`find -exec` `for i in glob` and `find`+`while` do not rely on word splitting, so they avoid this problem.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
for file in $(find somedir -mtime -7 -name '*.mp3')
do
  let count++
  echo "Playing file no. $count"
  play "$file"
done
echo "Played $count files"
```

This will fail for filenames containing spaces and similar, such as `Some File.mp3`, and has a series of potential globbing issues depending on other filenames in the directory like (if you have `SomeFile2.mp3` and `SomeFile[2014].mp3`, the former file will play twice and the latter will not play at all).

Example of **correct** code:

There are many possible fixes, each with its pros and cons.

The most general fix (that requires the least amount of thinking to apply) is having `find` output a `\0` separated list of files and consuming them in a `while read` loop:

```sh
while IFS= read -r -d '' file
do
  let count++
  echo "Playing file no. $count"
  play "$file"
done <   <(find somedir -mtime -7 -name '*.mp3' -print0)
echo "Played $count files"
```

In usage it's very similar to the `for` loop: it gets its output from a `find` statement, it executes a shell script body, it allows updating/aggregating variables, and the variables are available when the loop ends.

It requires Bash, and works with GNU, Busybox, OS X, FreeBSD and OpenBSD find, but not POSIX find.

#### Exceptions

If you know about and carefully apply `IFS=$'\n'` and `set -f`, you could choose to ignore this message.
