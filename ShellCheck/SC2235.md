Pattern: Use of `(..)` instead of `{ ..; }`

Issue: -

## Description

You appear to be using `(..)` to group test commands. This creates a subshell, making it unnecessarily slow. Avoid this by using `{ ..; }` to group.

Be careful to note that unlike `(..)`, this requires both a space after the `{` and a semicolon before the `}`.

For example, `(cmd)`, `(cmd;)` and `( cmd )` are all valid, but `{cmd}`, `{cmd;}` and `{ cmd }` are all syntax errors because they lack either or both of the spaces and semicolon. The correct form is `{ cmd; }`

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
([ "$x" ] || [ "$y" ]) && [ "$z" ]
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
{ [ "$x" ] || [ "$y" ]; } && [ "$z" ]
```
