Pattern: Use of literal `{` or `}` outside of quotes

Issue: -

## Description

If curly brackets don't appear alone at the start of an expression or as part of a parameter or brace expansion, the shell silently treats them as literals. This frequently indicates a bug, so _ShellCheck_ warns about it.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
rmf() { rm -f "$@" }
```

or

```sh
eval echo \${foo}
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
rmf() { rm -f "$@"; }
```

and

```sh
eval "echo \${foo}"
```

## Exceptions

This error is harmless when the curly brackets are supposed to be literal, in e.g. `awk {'print $1'}`. However, it's cleaner and less error prone to simply include them inside the quotes: `awk '{print $1}'`.
