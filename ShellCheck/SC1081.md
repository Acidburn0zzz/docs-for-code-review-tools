Pattern: Use of `If` instead of `if`

Issue: -

## Description

Shells are case sensitive and do not accept `If` or `IF` in place of lowercase `if`.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
If true
Then
  echo "hello"
Fi
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
if true
then
  echo "hello"
fi
```

## Exceptions

If you're aware of this and insist on naming a function `WHILE`, you can quote the name to prevent _ShellCheck_ from thinking you meant `while`.
