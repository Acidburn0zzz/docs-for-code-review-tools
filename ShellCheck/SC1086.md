Pattern: Use of `$` on iterator name in for loops

Issue: -

## Description

The variable is named `var`, and can be expanded to its value with `$var`.

The `for` loop expects the variable's name, not its value (and the name can not be specified indirectly).

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
for $var in *
do
  echo "$var"
done
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
for var in *
do
  echo "$var"
done
```
