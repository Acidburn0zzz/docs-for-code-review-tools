Pattern: Missing `;` or `+` to terminate `-exec`

Issue: -

## Description

`find -exec` is still subject to all normal shell rules, so all shell features like `|`, `||`, `&` and `&&` will apply to the `find` command itself, and not to the command you are trying to construct with `-exec`.

`find . -exec foo {} && bar {} \;` means run the command `find . -exec foo {}`, and if find is successful, run the command `bar "{}" ";"`.

To instead go through each file and run `foo file && bar file` on it, invoke a shell that can interpret `&&`:

```sh
find . -exec sh 'foo "$1" && bar "$1"' -- {} \;
```

You can also use find `-a` instead of shell `&&`:

```sh
find . -exec foo {} \; -a -exec bar {} \;
```

This will have the same effect (`-a` is also the default when two commands are specified, and can therefore be omitted).

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
find . -type f -exec shellcheck {} | wc -l \;
find . -exec echo {} ;
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
find . -type f -exec sh -c 'shellcheck "$1" | wc -l' -- {} \;
find . -exec echo {} \;
```
