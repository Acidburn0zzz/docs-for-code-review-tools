Pattern: Missing use of `"$@"` to prevent whitespace problems

Issue: -

## Description

`$*`, unquoted, is subject to word splitting and globbing.

Let's say you have three arguments: `baz`, `foo bar` and `*`

`"$@"` will expand into exactly that: `baz`, `foo bar` and `*`

`$*` will expand into multiple other arguments: `baz`, `foo`, `bar`, `file.txt` and `otherfile.jpg`

Since the latter is rarely expected or desired, ShellCheck warns about it.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
cp $* ~/dir
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
cp "$@" ~/dir
```
