Pattern: Missing hash for the shebang

Issue: -

## Description

You appear to be specifying an interpreter in a shebang, but it's missing the hash part. The shebang must always start with `#!`.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
!/bin/sh
echo "Hello"
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
echo "Hello"
```
