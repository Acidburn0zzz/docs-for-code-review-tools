Pattern: Text after the terminating token in shell script

Issue: -

## Description

You have a here-document, and appear to have added text after the terminating token.

This is not allowed. If it was meant to continue the command, put it on the line with the `<<`.

If it helps, look at << "END" as if it was < file, and make sure the resulting command is valid. This is what the shell does. You can then append here-document data after the command.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
cat << EOF
Hello
EOF | nl
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
cat << EOF | nl
Hello
EOF
```
