Pattern: Missing use of explicit `-n` to check for output

Issue: -

## Description

`[ "$(mycommand)" ]` is equivalent to `[ -n "$(mycommand)" ]` and checks whether the command's output on stdout was non-empty.

Users more familiar with other languages are often surprised to learn that it is nothing like e.g. `if (myfunction())`, since it does not care about what the command/function `return`s.

Using an explicit `-n` helps clarify that this is purely a string operation. And of course, if the intention was to check whether the command ran successfully, now would be a good time to fix it as in the alternate example.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
if [ "$(mycommand --myflags)" ]
then
  echo "True"
fi
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
# Check that the command outputs something on stdout
if [ -n "$(mycommand --myflags)" ]
then
  echo "The command had output on stdout"
fi

# Check instead that the command succeeded (exit code = 0)
if mycommand --myflags
then
  echo "The command reported success"
fi
```

## Exceptions

If you are familiar with the semantics of `[`, you can ignore this suggestion.
