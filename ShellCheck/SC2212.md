Pattern: Use of `[ ]` instead of `false`

Issue: -

## Description

`[ ]` is a somewhat obscure way of expressing falsehood, and the behavior is likely intended to allow the incorrectly quoted command `[ $var ]` to still work when the variable is unset.

POSIX has a more descriptive command `false` for this.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
if [ ]
then
  echo "Temporarily disabled"
fi
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
if false
then
  echo "Temporarily disabled"
fi
```
