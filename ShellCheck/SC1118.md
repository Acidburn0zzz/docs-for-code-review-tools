Pattern: Whitespace after the here-doc end token

Issue: -

## Description

The end token of your here-document has trailing whitespace. This is invisible to the naked eye, but shells do not accept it.

Remove the trailing whitespace.

Example of **incorrect** code:

"▭" below indicates an otherwise invisible space:

```sh
cat << "eof"
Hello
eof▭   
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
cat << "eof"
Hello
eof
```
