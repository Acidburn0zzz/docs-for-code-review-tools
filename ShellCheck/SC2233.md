Pattern: Redundant `(..)` around condition

Issue: -

## Description

You're wrapping `(..)` around one or more condition. This is unnecessary, and the resulting fork adds overhead. Delete the surrounding `(..)` since they serve no purpose and only slows the script down.

The shell syntax is `if cmd`, `elif cmd`, `while cmd` and `until cmd` without any parentheses. Parentheses are an independent construct used to create subshells.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
if ([ "$x" -gt 0 ])
then true; fi
```
