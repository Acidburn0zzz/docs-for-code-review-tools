Pattern: Use of `-p` with `-m` in shell script

Issue: -

## Description

When using `-m 0755`, the mode of the directory created will be set to 0755. When using `-p`, parent directories which do not exist will be created, but the mode specified by `-m` will only be used on the last directory. The parent directories will get their access mode the default way, via `umask()`.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
mkdir -p -m 0755 foo/bar/baz
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
mkdir -p foo/bar/baz
chmod 0755 foo/bar/baz foo/bar foo
```

## Exceptions

ShellCheck does not warn if the path only has one component, as in `mkdir -p -m 0755 mydir`, but will not attempt to determine whether this applies for a variable as in `mkdir -p -m 0755 "$mydir"`. You can mkdir/chmod separately or ignore this message.
