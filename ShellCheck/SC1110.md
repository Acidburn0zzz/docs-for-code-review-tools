Pattern: Use of Unicode quote

Issue: -

## Description

Some software, like OS X, Word and WordPress, may automatically replace your regular quotes with slanted Unicode quotes. Try deleting and retyping them, and/or disable “smart quotes” in your editor or OS.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
echo ‘hello world’
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
echo 'hello world'
```

## Exceptions

If you want to use typographic single quotes, you can put them in double quotes (or typographic double quotes in single quotes) to make shellcheck ignore them, e.g.,

```sh
printf "Warning: ‘wakeonlan’ is not installed.\n"
```
