Pattern: Incorrect use of _Bash_ keyword

Issue: -

## Description

This error is typically seen when there are too many `fi`, `done` or `esac`s, or when there's a `do` or `then` without a corresponding `while`, `for` or `if`. This is often due to deleting a loop or conditional statement but not its terminator.

In some cases, it can even be caused by bad quoting:

```sh
var="foo
if [[ $var = "bar ]
then
  echo true
fi
```

In this case, the `if` ends up inside the double quotes, leaving the `then` dangling.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
if true
then
  echo hello
fi
fi
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
if true
then
  echo hello
fi
```
