Pattern: Unknown _ShellCheck_ directive

Issue: -

## Description

ShellCheck doesn't recognize the directive you're trying to use in a `# shellcheck` comment.

It could be misspelled, or you could be using an older version of ShellCheck that doesn't support it yet.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
# shellcheck foobar=baz
echo "Hello World"
```

Example of **correct** code:

Depends on your intention.
