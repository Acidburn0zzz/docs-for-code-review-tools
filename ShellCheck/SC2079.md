Pattern: Invalid decimal comparison

Issue: -

## Description

Bash arithmetic conditional evaluation can only be performed on integers. Bash has limited data types which [include integer](http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/declareref.html), but everything is effectively [untyped](http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/untyped.html).

Use `bc` or `awk` to resolve.
