Pattern: Use of multidimensional array in _Bash_

Issue: -

## Description

Bash does not support multidimensional arrays. Rewrite it to use 1D arrays. Associative arrays map arbitrary strings to values, and are therefore useful since you can construct keys like `"1,2,3"` or `"val1;val2;val3"` to index them.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
foo[1][2]=bar
echo "${foo[1][2]}"
```

Example of **correct** code:

In bash4, consider using associative arrays:
```sh
declare -A foo
foo[1,2]=bar
echo "${foo[1,2]}"
```

Otherwise, do your own index arithmetic:
```sh
size=10
foo[1*size+2]=bar
echo "${foo[1*size+2]}"
```
