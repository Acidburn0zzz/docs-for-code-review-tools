Pattern: Use of `´` for command expansion

Issue: -

## Description

In some fonts it's hard to tell ticks apart, but Bash strongly distinguishes between backticks (grave accent `` ` ``), forward ticks (acute accent `´`) and regular ticks (apostrophe `'`).

Backticks start command expansions, while forward ticks are literal.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
echo "Your username is ´whoami´"
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
echo "Your username is $(whoami)" # Preferred
echo "Your username is `whoami`"  # Deprecated, will give [SC2006]
```

## Exceptions

If you want to write out literal forward ticks, such as fancy ASCII quotation marks:

```sh
echo "``The Internet is becoming the town square for the global village of tomorrow.´´  - Bill Gates"
```

use single quotes instead:

```sh
echo '``The Internet is becoming the town square for the global village of tomorrow.´´  - Bill Gates'
```

To nest forward ticks in command expansion, use `$(..)` instead of `` `..` ``.
