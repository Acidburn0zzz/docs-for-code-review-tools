Pattern: Masking return value in Shell script

Issue: -

## Description

In the original code, the return value of `mycmd` is ignored, and `export` will instead always return true. This may prevent conditionals, `set -e` and traps from working correctly.

When first marked for export and assigned separately, the return value of the assignment will be that of `mycmd`. This avoids the problem.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
export foo="$(mycmd)"
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
foo=$(mycmd)
export foo
```

## Exceptions

If you intend to ignore the return value of an assignment, you can either ignore this warning or use

```sh
foo=$(mycmd) || true
export foo
```

Shellcheck does not warn about `export foo=bar` because `bar` is a literal and not a command substitution with an independent return value. It also does not warn about `local -r foo=$(cmd)`, where declaration and assignment must be in the same command.
