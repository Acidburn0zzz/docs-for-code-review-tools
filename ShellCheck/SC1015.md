Pattern: Use of Unicode double quote

Issue: -

## Description

Various software and word processors frequently replaces ASCII quotes `""` with fancy Unicode quotes, `“”`. To bash, Unicode quotes are considered regular literals and not quotes at all.

Simply delete them and retype them in your editor.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
echo “hello world”
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
echo "hello world"
```

## Exceptions

If you really want literal Unicode double quotes, you can put them in single quotes (or Unicode single quotes in double quotes) to make shellcheck ignore them, e.g.,

```sh
printf 'Warning: “wakeonlan” is not installed.\n'
```
