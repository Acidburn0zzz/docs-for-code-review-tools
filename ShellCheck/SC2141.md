Pattern: Missing use of `IFS=$'\t'`

Issue: -

## Description

`IFS="\t"` splits on backslash and the letter "t". `IFS=$'\t'` splits on tab.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
IFS="\t"
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
IFS=$'\t'
```

## Exceptions

It's extremely rare to want to split on the letter "n" or "t", rather than linefeed or tab.
