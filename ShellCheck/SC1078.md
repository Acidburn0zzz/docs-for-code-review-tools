Pattern: Missing opening `"` for shell script

Issue: -

## Description

This rule warns when it detects multi-line double quoted, single quoted or backticked strings when the character that follows it looks out of place.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
greeting="hello
target="world"
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
greeting="hello"
target="world"
```

## Exceptions

If you do want a multi-line variable, just make sure the character after it is a quote, space or line feed.

```sh
var='multiline
'value
```

can be rewritten for readability and to remove the warning:

```sh
var='multiline
value'
```

As always `` `..` `` should be rewritten to ``$(..)``.
