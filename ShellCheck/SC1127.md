Pattern: Use of C-style comment in shell script

Issue: -

## Description

ShellCheck found what appears to be a C-style comment, a line starting with `//` or `/*`.

In Bourne based shell scripts, the comment character is `#`

Example of **incorrect** code:

```C
// This is a comment.
/* This too. */
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
# This is a comment.
# This too.
```
