Pattern: Unmatched `case` statement in shell script

Issue: -

## Description

ShellCheck has detected that one of the patterns in a `case` statement will never match. 

Often, this is due to mistakes in the case statement word that results in unintended literal characters.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
case "$var " in      # Trailing space
  value) echo "Match"
esac
```

Here there's a trailing space that will prevent the match from ever succeeding.

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
case "${var}" in     # No trailing space
  value) echo "Match"
esac
```
