Pattern: Use of number with leading `0`

Issue: -

## Description

ShellCheck found an integer literal with a leading zero, but containing the digits 8 or 9.

This is invalid, as the integer will be interpreted as an octal value (e.g. 0777 == 0x1FF == 511).

To have the value parsed in base 10, either remove the leading zeros as in the example, or specify the radix explicitly:

    echo $((10#08)) 

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
echo $(( 16 - 08 ))
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
echo $(( 16 - 8 ))
```
