Pattern: Possible misuse of shell file redirection

Issue: -

## Description

A word that looks like a redirection in simple shell commands causes it to be interpreted as a redirection.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
[ 1 >2 ] || [ 3>'aaa bb' ] # Simple example of problematic code
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
[ 1 -gt 2 ] || [ 3 \> 'aaa bb' ] # arithmetical, lexicographical
```
## Exceptions

When it's among a continuous list of redirections at the end of a simple `test` command, it's more likely that
the user really meant to do a redirection. Or any other case that you mean to do that.
