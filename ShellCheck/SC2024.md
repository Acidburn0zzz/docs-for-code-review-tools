Pattern: Possible misuse of `sudo` with redirect

Issue: -

## Description

Redirections are performed by the current shell before `sudo` is started. This means that it will use the current shell's user and permissions to open and write to the file.

`tee` is a simple command that opens and writes to files without help from the shell, which means that it will use the permissions that `sudo` grants it.

There is nothing special about `tee`. It's just the simplest command that can both truncate and append to files without help from the shell. Here are equivalent alternatives:

Truncating:

```
echo 'data' | sudo dd of=file
echo 'data' | sudo sed 'w file'
```

Appending: 

```
echo 'data' | sudo awk '{ print $0 >> "file" }'
echo 'data' | sudo sh -c 'cat >> file'
```

Example of **incorrect** code:

```
sudo echo 'export FOO=bar' >> /etc/profile
```

Example of **correct** code:

```
echo 'export FOO=bar' | sudo tee -a /etc/profile > /dev/null
```

## Exceptions

If you want to run a command as root but redirect as the normal user, you can ignore this message.
