Pattern: Unquoted option for `find`

Issue: -

## Description

Several find options take patterns to match against, including `-ilname`, `-iname`, `-ipath`, `-iregex`, `-iwholename`, `-lname`, `-name`, `-path`, `-regex` and `-wholename`.

These compete with the shell's pattern expansion, and must therefore be quoted so that they are passed literally to `find`.

The example command may end up executing as `find . -name README.txt` after the shell has replaced the `*.txt` with a matching file `README.txt` from the current directory. 

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
find . -name *.txt
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
find . -name '*.txt'
```
