Pattern: Use of literal backslash in double quoted string

Issue: -

## Description

In a double quoted string, you have escaped a character that has no special behavior when escaped. Instead, it's invoking the fallback behavior of being interpreted literally.

Instead of relying on this implicit fallback, you should escape the backslash explicitly. This makes it clear that it's meant to be passed as a literal backslash in the string parameter.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
printf "%s\n" "Hello"
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
printf "%s\\n" "Hello"
```

or alternatively, with single quotes:

```sh
printf '%s\n' "Hello"
```
