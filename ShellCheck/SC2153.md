Pattern: Possible variable misspelling

Issue: -

## Description

You reference a variable that is not assigned in the script, which has a name remarkably similar to one that is explicitly assigned. You should verify that the variable name is spelled correctly.

Note: This error only triggers for environment variables (all uppercase variables), and only when they have names similar to something assigned in the script. If the variable is script-local, it should by convention have a lowercase name.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
MY_VARIABLE="hello world"
echo "$MYVARIABLE"
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
MY_VARIABLE="hello world"
echo "$MY_VARIABLE"
```

## Exceptions

If you've double checked and ensured that you did not intend to reference the specified variable, you can disable this message with a directive. The message will also not appear for guarded references like `${ENVVAR:-default}` or `${ENVVAR:?Unset error message here}`.
