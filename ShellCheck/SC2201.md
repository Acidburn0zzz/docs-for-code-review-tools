Pattern: Use of brace expansion in `[[ ]]`

Issue: -

## Description

Brace expansions doesn't happen in `[[ ]]`. They will just be interpreted literally.

Instead, use a `for` loop to iterate over values, and apply your condition to each.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
[[ "$file" = index.{htm,html,php} ]] && echo "This is the main file"
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
for main in index.{htm,html,php}
do
  [[ "$file" = "$main" ]] && echo "This is the main file"
done
```
