Pattern: Missing space after `{`

Issue: -

## Description

`{` is only recognized as the start of a command group when it's a separate token.

If it's not a separate token, like in the problematic example, it will be considered a literal character, as if writing `"{echo"` with quotes, and therefore usually cause a syntax error.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
foo() {echo "hello world;}
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
foo() { echo "hello world;}
```
