Pattern: Missing use of explicit `-n` to check non-empty string

Issue: -

## Description

`[ "$var" ]` is equivalent to `[ -n "$var" ]` and checks whether the string is non-empty.

Users more familiar with other languages are therefore often surprised to learn that `[ "$var" ]` is true when `var=false` or `var=0`.

Adding the explicit `-n` helps clarify that this is a string comparison, and not related to any concept of boolean values or comparisons as it is in most languages.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
if [ "$1" ]
then
  echo "True"
fi
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
# Check if $1 is empty or non-empty
if [ -n "$1" ]
then
  echo "True, $1 is a non-empty value"
fi

# Check instead if $1 is true or false, as in Java
[ "$1" = "true" ]

# Check instead if $1 is non-zero or zero, as in C
[ "$1" -ne 0 ]

# Check instead if $1 is defined (even if just assigned the empty string) or undefined
[ "${1+x}" = "x" ]

```

## Exceptions

If you are familiar with the semantics of `[`, you can ignore this suggestion.
