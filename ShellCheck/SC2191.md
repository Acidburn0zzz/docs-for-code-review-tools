Pattern: Use of literal `=`

Issue: -

## Description

The shell doesn't care about the `=` sign in your array assignment because it's not part of a recognized index assignment. Instead, it's considered a literal character and becomes part of an array element's value.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
array=( [index] = value )
```

Here the `=` was intended to set the index, but the shell will not recognize it when it is surrounded by spaces.

Make sure to remove any spaces around the `=` when assigning by index, such as in the correct code.

If you wanted the `=` to be a literal part of the array element, add quotes around it, such as `env=( "LC_CTYPE=C" )` or `specialChars=( "=" "%" ";" )` .

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
array=( [index]=value )
```
