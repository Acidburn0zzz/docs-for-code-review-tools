Pattern: Incorrect order for `2>&1` and redirect

Issue: -

## Description

Redirections are handled in order. If you want stderr as stdout and stdout to a file, you can ignore this warning.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
firefox 2>&1 > /dev/null
```

This means "Point stderr to where stdout is currently pointing (the terminal). Then point stdout to `/dev/null`".

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
firefox 2>&1 > /dev/null
```

This means "Point stdout to `/dev/null`. Then point stderr to where stdout is currently pointing (`/dev/null`)".
