Pattern: Use of keyword as literal

Issue: -

## Description

`done`, `then`, `do`, `fi` and `esac` only work as a keyword when they are the first token of the command. If added after a command, it will just be the literal word.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```
for f in *; do echo "$f" done
```

or

```
echo $f is done
```

Example of **correct** code:

```
for f in *; do echo "$f"; done
```

or

```
echo "$f is done"

```

## Exceptions

If you're intentionally using `done` as a literal, you can quote it to make this clear to _ShellCheck_ (and also human readers), e.g. instead of `echo Task is done`, use `echo "Task is done"`. This makes no difference to the shell, but it will silence this warning.
