Pattern: Use of `trap` with signal number

Issue: -

## Description

Signal numbers can vary between platforms. Prefer signal names, which are fixed.

Signal numbers 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 14 and 15 are specified as parts of the optional POSIX XSI and ShellCheck will not warn about these. 

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
trap somefunc 28
```

Example of **correct** code:

trap somefunc WINCH
