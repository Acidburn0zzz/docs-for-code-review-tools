Pattern: Missing curly braces for array expansion

Issue: -

## Description

For compatibility reasons, `$foo[bar]` is interpreted as the variable `$foo` followed by the literal string `[bar]`.

Curly braces are needed to tell the shell that the square brackets are part of the expansion.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
echo "$array[@]"
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
echo "${array[@]}"
```

## Exceptions

If you want the square brackets to be treated literally or as a glob, you can use `${var}[idx]` to prevent this warning.
