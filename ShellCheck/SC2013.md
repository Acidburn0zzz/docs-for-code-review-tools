Pattern: Missing use of `while read` loop

Issue: -

## Description

For loops by default (subject to `$IFS`) read word by word. Additionally, glob expansion will occur.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
for line in $(cat file | grep -v '^ *#')
do
  echo "Line: $line"
done
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
grep -v '^ *#' < file | while IFS= read -r line
do
  echo "Line: $line"
done
```

or without a subshell (bash, zsh, ksh):

```sh
while IFS= read -r line
do
  echo "Line: $line"
done < <(grep -v '^ *#' < file)
```

or without a subshell, with a pipe (more portable, but write a file on the filesystem):

```sh
mkfifo somepipe
grep -v '^ *#' < file > somepipe &
while IFS= read -r line
do
  echo "Line: $line"
done < somepipe
rm somepipe
```

## Exceptions

If you want to read word by word, you should still use a while read loop (e.g. with `read -a` to read words into an array).

Rare reasons for ignoring this message is if you don't care because your file only contains numbers and you're not interested in good practices, or if you've set `$IFS` appropriately and also disabled globbing.
