Pattern: Use of `=~` in `[ ]`

Issue: -

## Description

`=~` only works in `[[ .. ]]` tests. It does not work with `test` or `[` in any shell.

If you're targeting POSIX `sh`, rewrite in terms of `case` or `grep` instead.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
[ "$input" =~ DOC[0-9]*\.txt ] && echo "match"
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
[[ "$input" =~ DOC[0-9]*\.txt ]] && echo "match"
```
