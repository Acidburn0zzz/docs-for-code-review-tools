Pattern: Possible SQL injection via string-based query construction

Issue: -

## Description

An SQL injection attack consists of insertion or "injection" of a SQL query
via the input data given to an application. It is a very common attack vector.
This rule looks for strings that resemble SQL statements that are
involved in some form of string building operation. For example:

- `"SELECT %s FROM derp;" % var`
- `"SELECT thing FROM " \+ tab`
- `"SELECT " \+ val + " FROM " \+ tab + ...`
- `"SELECT {} FROM derp;".format(var)`

Unless care is taken to sanitize and control the input data when building such
SQL statement strings, an injection attack becomes possible.


Example of **insecure** code:

```python
import MySQLdb

query = "select username from users where username = '%s'" % name
con = MySQLdb.connect('localhost', 'testuser', 'test623', 'testdb');

with con:
    cur = con.cursor()
    cur.execute(query)
```

Example of **secure** code:

```python
import MySQLdb

query = "select username from users where username = '%s'" % name
con = MySQLdb.connect('localhost', 'testuser', 'test623', 'testdb');

with con:
    cur = con.cursor()
    cur.execute(MySQLdb.escape_string(query))
```

In this example the query is created using pythons standard, unsafe `%` operator. MySQLâ€™s `escape_string()` method is used to perform escaping on the query string immediately before executing it.
